== Running OsmoGbProxy

The OsmoGbProxy executable (`osmo-gbproxy`) offers the following command-line
options:


=== SYNOPSIS

*-V, --version*::
	Print the compile-time version number of the program
*-d, --debug 'DBGMASK','DBGLEVELS'*::

*-D, --daemonize*::
	Fork the process as a daemon into background.
*-c, --config-file 'CONFIGFILE'*::

	deprecated by VTY based logging configuration, see <<logging>>
	for more information.
*-e, --log-level 'LOGLEVEL'*::
	Set the global log level for logging to stderr. This has mostly
	been deprecated by VTY based logging configuration, see
	<<logging>> for more information.
*-T, --timestamp*::

        has mostly been deprecated by VTY based logging configuration, see
