== Running OsmoGbPROXY

The OsmoGbPROXY executable (`osmo-gbproxy`) offers the following command-line

*-V, --version*::
	Print the compile-time version number of the OsmoSGSN program
*-d, --debug 'DBGMASK','DBGLEVELS'*::

	deprecated by VTY based logging configuration, see <<logging>>
	for more information.
*-e, --log-level 'LOGLEVEL'*::

	been deprecated by VTY based logging configuration, see

        has mostly been deprecated by VTY based logging configuration, see
